Hi there! My name is Louis Gomez, originally from Lagos, Nigeria. I am currently a Doctoral Student in Computer Science at the Stevens Institute of Technology. I am also a Research Assistant in the Health and AI Lab under the mentorship of [Dr. Samantha Kleinberg](http://www.skleinberg.org/).

My research interests primarily lie in applications of machine learning in healthcare. I am interested in how healthcare data can be used to make better health decisions for both medical doctors and individuals. My current research projects involve classifying consciousness in a neurological ICU, meal detection for individuals with type 2 diabetes, and simulation of medical time series data.

In my downtime, I listen to podcasts with themes of either economics, science, or black twitter. Documentaries are also a favorite pastime.
